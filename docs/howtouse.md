# How To Use This Book

This book is meant to be a thorough guide that walks you through the Python programming language. Throughout the book, you will encounter different code blocks. They will be formatted in the following ways:

## Inline Code blocks

Inline code blocks will look like `this`. These will _always_ refer to python code.

## Multi-line Code blocks

We will be using multi-line code blocks throughout this book. The we will vary between python code and bash (or Powershell on Windows). Generally, books will denote bash by adding a `$` to the front of a line,however I find that this leads to issues when people try to copy and paste code from this book to their editor. For this reason I've opted to title all command line code sections _Command Line_. Regular multi-line code blocks will have the same name as the file they are intended to be written in.

### Command Line Code Block Example

```bash title='Command Line'
mkdir python_project
touch python_project/hello_world.py
```

### Python Multi-line Code Block Example

```py title='hello_world.py'
print("Hello World")
```
